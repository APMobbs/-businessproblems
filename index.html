        <h2> What causes digital projects to fail? </h2>
        here are a few things that can present a challange to digital projects and lead the to failure.
        <li> Overambition - A lot of projects shoot for the stars but get lost on the way, trying to making it perfect 
            and add new features and functions but this can lead to a lack of focus and end up with the no budget left to
            because plans are spread to thin.
        </li>
        <li> Poor Digital Strategy - Many digital projects have a limited mind set and only of focusing on one aspect
            of the project. one way to avoid this is come up with an end goal, define what the success of the projects looks like 
            and work towards it.
        </li>
        <li> Lack of Flexible - The old ways of having a "5-year-plans" is no longer sustianible, in the modren era projects
            need to be able to adapt with changing landscape and market, with the ability to pivot at a moments notice. A 
            project that is unable to stay up to date will be left behind.
        </li>
        <li> Uniformity in skill - Many digital projects make the mistake of only having one type of person in there
           the team which will only lead to an echochamber where no challanges the bad ideas. It is important to have
           a diverse range of people with different types of people with their own skills, make sure you have people who
           know the business side of things this will help to know how to stay competitive.
        </li>
        <li> Mismarketing - pitching a project can be difficult and sometimes the marketing team over sell and over 
            promise espically when they are trying to use new technology. losing sight of their goals on the hype of new
            technology but it's important to stay ground and take things one step at a time.
        </li>

        <h2> How does GDPR impact digital projects? </h2>
        
        GDPR is regulation that was put into place by the EU parliament and it stands for General Data Protection Regulation.
        althought it was passed in 2016, GDPR was not enforced until 25th May 2019 which is why around that time you were
        probably getting emails from every website you ever made an account for.

<br><br>

        The purpose of the regulation is to give people control of their personal data and how international business use their
        data, GDPR was also put in place to make it easier to understand environment for international business by unifying the 
        regulation within the EU. GDPR has provisions and requirements that relate to how businesses (regardless of location)
        use the personal data of individuals (or data subjects as they are referred to in the regulation) within the EU.

<br><br>

        So how does this affect digital projects, simply put; any ditgital projects that take data for the pubic need 
        to ensure sure that they are follow GDPR regulations, here are a few small things you can do to ensure you are GDPR
        complant, if your website uses cookie make sure that the user consents to the use of cookies, it you want to take
        personal data make it an opt in process, if their is any breach of data it must be reported to you clients and if 
        your unsure about anything else take a look ar how other business in your area are doing things their no clear
        rules with GDPR and if one company is compilant you can follow their lead.

        <h2> How would you go about testing digital solutions?</h2>
        Working in the digital space can be daunting and a lot can go wrong, it is operative that you thoroughly testing anything you working on in the digital space.
        Depending on what your making there are different ways of testing it, for software you can have Alpha and Beta testers test your software and report any bugs
        they find, this can be done with the pubic or allow a small groip of people to come in privatly and test. There are also 3rd party companies like Sogeti who 
        you can to test your digital solutions. 

        One common way people the digital industry go about testing is using a test plan table, this table will usual have 4 columns witch read as follows; "What 
        Should Happen", "What Did Happen", "Screenshot" and "Fix (if needed)" with this table a tester will go through their the digital solution and log thier

        <h2> How do copyright and other constraints affect websites? </h2>
        Copyright law is a legal right which is used to protect works once they have been put into physical exression. current legislation on copyright in the UK is the "Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988".
        The law puts out a framework of rules which allows the hold to do more things with thier work once it's under copyright, things like copy, change or sell it, share it online or rent it to someone it also
        prevents other form doing any of the pervious list things.
        
        That prevention is what restricts what you can and can't use on your website, companys protect their copyright vehemently so a breach of copyright law could mean serious problem for your website so always 
        ask if you can use anyone else work before you do. their are also places you can find some types of works which you can use freely, for example you can get royalty free images and music online, website like
        Unsplash for images or Bensound for music have tons of works you can use for free with no need to ask permisson, just thanks if you want to.
