        <h2> What causes digital projects to fail? </h2>
        here are a few things that can present a challange to digital projects and lead the to failure.
        <li> Overambition - A lot of projects shoot for the stars but get lost on the way, trying to making it perfect 
            and add new features and functions but this can lead to a lack of focus and end up with the no budget left to
            because plans are spread to thin.
        </li>
        <li> Poor Digital Strategy - Many digital projects have a limited mind set and only of focusing on one aspect
            of the project. one way to avoid this is come up with an end goal, define what the success of the projects looks like 
            and work towards it.
        </li>
        <li> Lack of Flexible - The old ways of having a "5-year-plans" is no longer sustianible, in the modren era projects
            need to be able to adapt with changing landscape and market, with the ability to pivot at a moments notice. A 
            project that is unable to stay up to date will be left behind.
        </li>
        <li> Uniformity in skill - Many digital projects make the mistake of only having one type of person in there
           the team which will only lead to an echochamber where no challanges the bad ideas. It is important to have
           a diverse range of people with different types of people with their own skills, make sure you have people who
           know the business side of things this will help to know how to stay competitive.
        </li>
        <li> Mismarketing - pitching a project can be difficult and sometimes the marketing team over sell and over 
            promise espically when they are trying to use new technology. losing sight of their goals on the hype of new
            technology but it's important to stay ground and take things one step at a time.

        this affect digital projects, simply put; any ditgital projects that take data for the pubic need to ensure sure that they
        are follow GDPR regulations.
